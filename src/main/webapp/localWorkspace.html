        The TFS source control workspace type is either <em>local</em> or <em>server</em>.<br/>
        This plugin provides a global configuration and a job configuration for the TFS workspace type.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, server workspaces are used on all related jobs by applying the global configuration value.<br/>
        If you change the global value to local workspaces, the job values will also change by default.<br/>
        If you want a different job value, you are always able to override it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Local workspaces were introduced with Team Foundation Server 2012.<br/>
        They allow edits, renames and deletes to be done locally without any communication to the server.<br/>
