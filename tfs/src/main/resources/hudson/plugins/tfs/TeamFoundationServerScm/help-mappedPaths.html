      Mapped paths will be pulled into the local workspace during a GET
      from the TFVC repository even if the parent folder is cloaked.
      <br />
      Check-ins that contain files only in mapped folders will trigger a build,
      whereas a check-in containing any path that is in a sub-folder of a cloaked folder
      will not trigger a build.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, suppose the <b>Project path</b> is <tt>$/Example/project/path</tt>,
      and the repository contains the following subfolders:
      <blockquote>
        $/Example/project/path/A <br />
        $/Example/project/path/A/1 <br />
        $/Example/project/path/A/2 <br />
        $/Example/project/path/B <br />
        $/Example/project/path/B/1 <br />
        $/Example/project/path/B/2 <br />
        $/Example/project/path/C <br />
      </blockquote>
      Now, suppose the following paths were entered as <b>Cloaked Paths</b>:
      <blockquote>
        $/Example/project/path/A/2 <br />
        $/Example/project/path/B <br />
      </blockquote>
      And the following paths were <b>Mapped Paths</b>:
      <blockquote>
          $/Example/project/path/B/1 : project/path/B1/1 <br />
      </blockquote>
      ...then the resulting workspace on the Jenkins server would only have the following folders:
      <blockquote>
        [Workspace_Directory]/Example/project/path/A <br />
        [Workspace_Directory]/Example/project/path/A/1 <br />
        [Workspace_Directory]/Example/project/path/C <br />
        [Workspace_Directory]/project/path/B/1 <br />
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      To continue with the example,
      the following check-in <em>will not</em> trigger a build,
      because it only contains changes under cloaked paths:
      <blockquote>
        $/Example/project/path/A/2/alpha.txt <br />
        $/Example/project/path/A/2/second.txt <br />
        $/Example/project/path/B/bravo.txt <br />
      </blockquote>
      ...whereas this check-in <em>will</em> trigger a build,
      because it contains at least one path that isn't cloaked:
      <blockquote>
        $/Example/project/path/A/2/second.txt <br />
        $/Example/project/path/B/bravo.txt <br />
        $/Example/project/path/B/2/other.txt <br />
      </blockquote>
    </p>
  </div>
